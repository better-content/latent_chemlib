# Latent ChemLib

Latent ChemLib is a Forge `1.20.1` mod for file-configured ChemLib matter
simulation. It provides containment machinery, high energy reaction math, gas
item escape behavior, an AdPother atmospheric boundary, and heavy-element
neutron economy hooks for expert modpacks.

The design goal is emergent behavior from numeric traits and curve intercepts,
not hard-coded per-element special cases. Pack authors can tune chemical
identity through datapack JSON while the mod derives fallback traits from
ChemLib registry data.

## Current Features

- A narrow atmospheric boundary that turns contained ChemLib gases into native
  AdPother pollutant blocks and captures native pollutant blocks back into the
  explicit gas-capture machine.
- A conserved bridge ratio of 16 Latent mass per AdPother unit. Release is
  preflighted atomically, while AdPother remains the sole authority for ambient
  density, movement, wind, spreading, impacts, protection, detection,
  explosions, filtering, chimney routing, and cleanup.
- Gas item escape handling for item entities and player inventories.
- Heavy element neutron flux simulation for ChemLib element stacks.
- Data-driven fixed radioactive-family profiles selected by exact item/block ID
  or item/block tag, with independent radiation and radiogenic heat strengths.
- Persistent disturbance sidecars which keep natural hosted uranium/thorium ore
  inert while making mined, carried, dropped, contained, and replaced forms active.
- A read-only `LatentEmissionProfiles` API for stack and placed-form consumers;
  fixed Realistic Ores profiles do not create or require isotope NBT.
- Create-style machine blocks:
  - `latent_chemlib:gas_capture`
  - `latent_chemlib:gas_tank`
  - `latent_chemlib:gas_reaction_chamber`
  - `latent_chemlib:gas_release`
  - `latent_chemlib:pneumatic_chemical_tube`
  - `latent_chemlib:dry_air_separator`
- A selectable PNCR boundary whose default air mode participates in the native
  pressure network and whose chemical mode transports the complete Latent
  multi-species state. The native-air and chemical ledgers remain separate
  across mode changes; there is no implicit compatibility conversion.
- A dry-air separator which consumes finite native PNCR compressed-air batches
  and produces a conserved nitrogen/oxygen/argon/carbon-dioxide mixture through
  Latent's multi-species capability.
- File-based datapack reload support for:
  - `data/latent_chemlib/chemical_traits/*.json`
  - `data/latent_chemlib/scheduler_profiles/default.json`
- Server tick budget scheduler for contained-machine and neutron workloads.
- Unit tests for numeric curves and emergent simulation math.

## Tech Stack

- Minecraft `1.20.1`
- Forge `47.4.13`
- Java `17`
- Kotlin for Forge `4.11.0`
- Create `6.0.8`
- ChemLib `2.0.19`
- Heat Sync (mandatory typed thermal API)
- PneumaticCraft: Repressurized `6.0.22`
- EMI and JEI as optional client integrations

## Development

Common tasks:

```bash
./gradlew verifyFast
./gradlew verifyFull
./gradlew runClient
./gradlew runServer
```

The JVM unit coverage gate is intentionally focused on the pure simulation and
configuration core. Forge event handlers and block entities are integration
boundaries. The bundled Forge GameTests cover the current in-world block entity
surfaces: native atmospheric handoff, machine block entity creation, capture, release,
reaction chamber agitation, PNCR pressure-network participation, selectable
transport authority, lossless mixture movement, and finite dry-air separation.
`verifyFast` runs the JVM coverage gate. `verifyFull` adds the headless Forge GameTest pass without the old property-driven rerun path.

## Pack Configuration

Pack-side datapack examples are expected under:

```text
data/latent_chemlib/chemical_traits/
data/latent_chemlib/machine_profiles/
data/latent_chemlib/nuclear_forms/
data/latent_chemlib/scheduler_profiles/
```

Traits expose numeric levers such as atomic number, atomic mass, base state,
phase energy, volatility, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, instability,
absorption, neutron yield, and curve definitions. Scheduler profiles cap per
dimension and per second simulation work so large packs can tune the system
without recompiling the mod. Machine profiles separately own gameplay
capabilities and pacing: default and reaction-chamber heat capacity, chamber
charge capacity, contained mass capacity, and per-second chamber temperature,
charge, and energy conditioning rates. Machine profiles use the explicit
`bc.latent_chemlib.machine_profile.v1` schema.

## Notes

- Mod metadata is sourced from `gradle.properties`.
- The mod currently provides the simulation foundation and block/item registry.
  Pack-specific recipes, progression gates, and datapack tuning live in the
  consuming pack.
- Complex mixtures, temperature, charge, reaction, and nuclear state remain
  contained in machines and items. Atmospheric conversion uses 16 Latent mass
  per whole AdPother unit, discards sub-unit release remainder, and separates
  mixtures into distinct native pollutant blocks.

## Identity

The canonical identity is repository/artifact `latent-chemlib`, mod ID and resource namespace `latent_chemlib`, and Maven group `com.bettercontent`. Latent has a mandatory loader and typed binary dependency on Heat Sync, which owns the pack's thermal transport API; other consumers may use Latent's read-only emission API.
